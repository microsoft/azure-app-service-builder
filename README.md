# Azure App Service Builder

This repository is the customer resource and product feedback hub for Azure App Service Builder. Feedback can cover the whole product. This is not the product source code repository or a replacement for Azure Support.

App Service Builder is in **Private Preview for development/test, not production**. This public resource hub does not grant preview access or announce public service availability. See the [App Service Builder documentation](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/) for product instructions, prerequisites, and limitations.

## Agent skills plugin

The `builder` agent plugin contains one customer-facing skill, `app-service-builder`, for GitHub Copilot CLI and Claude Code. Install it through the repository-hosted marketplace using your installed host:

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```shell
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-app-service-builder
copilot plugin install builder@azure-app-service-builder
```

### Claude Code

```shell
claude plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-app-service-builder
claude plugin install builder@azure-app-service-builder
```

See [plugin installation and readiness limits](docs/agent-plugin.md) for verification commands and usage.

Plugin installation is separate from Builder CLI installation. Obtain the portable `azure-builder-cli-<version>.tgz` archive from the [official CLI releases](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-app-service-builder/releases) and follow the [Builder CLI quickstart](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/quickstarts/builder-cli/). Node.js 22 or later is required; the separate .NET runtime is only for local manifest commands, not login, initialization, or deployment. Customers do not need the .NET SDK.
